		<h2>What I Learnt</h2>
		<p>Throughout the process of developing my personal portfolio website, I learned a lot about HTML, CSS, and how they interact with each other. <br>

            Successes while making the portfolio website: <br>
            
            First Success: Finding the best way to edit the code <br>
            
            I found that using the live viewer add-in in VS Code for desktop created the best development environment, allowing me to see my changes in real time. This allowed me to almost check and guess the code along the way creating the most valuable learning method.<br>
            
            Second Success: Using resources available to learn and develop, as well as build my site<br>
            
            Whenever I got stuck, I was able to easily find information on the internet to help me overcome the problem. I now understand how HTML and CSS work together even more to create web pages and how JavaScript can be used to add interactivity to a website even more than before by having the opportunity to create a real interactive website.<br>
            
            Third Success: The responsiveness of the website and overall design<br>
            
            I am actually quite proud of the website overall. It is clean, and responsive and features all of the links and content that I wanted it to by its completion. What is a success for me is that I created the website from scratch without the use of a template. Many people told me they would be using templates as a base to their website design, however, I thought I’d take the challenge and the learning experience to build from a blank white page up, and started at the header and work my way down. I did this for the homepage and then copied the generic styling across to my other pages and adapted the content. I chose a colour theme from an online theme generator to use throughout too. <br>
            
            Although, I’d admit it’s certainly not the prettiest website I’ve seen, I’m happy that It was built from the ground up, and personally would say I’ve learnt more overall in doing so. Even the Menu icon itself I created in adobe illustrator and included itself, to create my own design rather than using someone else. I often found myself referring to some of my favourite websites to use, and then trying to imitate layout ideas that I knew were clean.<br>
            
            I have actually had Web development-based experience before creating websites for real clients in Perth, however, I’ve only used an interface like Wix, as it’s simple to hand over to a client after production. Some additions I’ve edited basic HTML or CSS for before, but never an entire website, so I’m looking forward to using this skillset in the future!<br>
            
            However, I also encountered some challenges along the way. <br>
            
            First Challenge: CSS styling for positioning<br>
            
            One of the areas I struggled with was using the float/block feature of CSS and aligning pages in rows or columns to achieve the desired effect. Additionally, I found it difficult to understand the difference between margin, padding, and other spacing options. Sometimes I would just guess which option to use, or guess and then test the live website to see what achieved the target appeal. <br>
            
            Second Challenge: File management<br>
            
            Another challenge I faced was keeping track of files, locations, and multiple HTML and CSS documents. It was hard to keep everything organized, and I often found myself confused about which file contained what information. I could see how in a large work environment this would require a very high level of accuracy and structure.<br>
            
            Third Challenge: JavaScript<br>
            
            Although I’ll admit that I definitely understand how the JavaScript is working and how to write/use some basic functions as we work together on them in class, when I have to start myself from scratch I was reminded of the difficulty of getting particular features to work and often referred back to google were applicable. It reminded me very much of my python use from last year, whereby the code would either work, or it wouldn’t, rather than HTML or CSS, whereby the code can be working but just not orientated as you were planning. I will definitely continue to work on this outside class before the next assessment.<br>
            
            Overall, developing my personal portfolio website was a great learning experience for me as a beginner in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While I faced some challenges, I was able to overcome them with the help of online resources and experimentation. I'm excited to continue learning and developing my skills in web development throughout the unit this semester!<br>
