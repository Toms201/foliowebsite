		<p>Hi! My name is Tom Sargent. I am a 3rd Year Commerce Student majoring in Business Information systems and Technology. I am a highly motivated and accomplished Bachelor of Commerce student at Curtin
			University, specializing in Business Information Technology and Information Systems. Over
			the past 4+ years, I have honed my skills in sales and business IT strategy & deployment,
			working closely with small businesses across Western Australia to implement effective IT
			systems and improve their overall efficiency.
			Throughout my career, I have demonstrated a strong track record of exceptional
			communication, organization, and leadership skills, which have enabled me to exceed sales
			targets, manage IT projects, and deliver tangible results. I am passionate about using
			technology to drive positive change and foster productivity across a wide range of
			industries, and I am constantly seeking out new opportunities to learn, develop, and grow in
			this dynamic field.
			Whether working independently or as part of a team, I am committed to delivering high quality work that meets or exceeds the expectations of my clients and colleagues. I am a
			positive, enthusiastic, and dedicated individual who thrives on challenge and is constantly
			seeking out new ways to improve and innovate. With a strong work ethic, a passion for
			technology, and a commitment to excellence, I am confident that I have the skills,
			experience, and drive to excel in any IT-related role.</p>
